The problem set relates loosely to several papers discussed in the class, and in particular to <a href='http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304387816000109'>\"Airtime Transfers and Mobile Communications: Evidence in the Aftermath of Natural Disasters\"</a>.

    "Download the three datasets from the course website (available on bCourses under files/PS2).\n",
    "- `cdr_sample.zip`: This dataset contains the full Call Detail Records of a few thousand individuals. These data have been pseudonymized and partially fabricated, to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of the subscribers. However, the data are not that different from the raw data that are collected by mobile phone operators throughout the world. \n",
    "    - There are six columns in this dataset: user_1 (ID of person placing call), user_2 (ID of person receiving call), date, time, tower_1 (location of user_1), and tower_2 (location of user_2). We have strategically sampled ~3600 users and their full call detail records. The users in the column user_1 are these 3600 users.\n",
    "    - Note that the column user_2 might also contain those ~3600 users. Therefore, when calculating the number of logged events per person, don't forget the column user_2. \n",
    "- `celltower_location.csv`: This dataset contains the geocordinates of each cell tower, along with the district in which it is located. We added some jitter to the original coordinates, but each tower still belongs to its original district. \n",
    "- `District_Boundary_2012_merge_kigali.zip`: This dataset is the district [shapefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile) of Rwanda. There are 30 districts in Rwanda, but we have merged the 3 districts that comprise the capital of Kigali. Thus, you will find 28 districts in the dataset.\n",

Imagine that you are constructing the first tables and figures in a research paper, and you wish to provide your reader with as much intuition as possible about what information is contained in your dataset. Be creative, but be disciplined. Your figures should be professional, carefully labelled, and easily interpreted.\n"

    "For each individual in the dataset, the CDR provides you with an intermittent stream of their approximate locations over time. What I would like you to do is to convert this streaming log data into a structured dataset that makes it possible to quantify and study internal migration in Rwanda. In particular, use the data you have to quantify the number of migration events that occur in each month that is contained in the CDR. Produce a single time-series figure that has \"Year-Month\" on the x-axis, and \"Number of observed migrations\" on the y-axis.\n",

As discussed in class, that approach has many flaws, so I strongly encourage you to come up with your own approach."
